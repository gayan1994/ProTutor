Regarding the issue of getting an internal server error when trying to retrieve all budget line records.

The error happens here.

I think it's because the JobType is added in the included properties here but


the BudgetLine doesn't have the JobType navigation property in it's entity.

Category,Department Section,Employee,Template,Budget properties are also not included as navigation properties in the BudgetLine entity
